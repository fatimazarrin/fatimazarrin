Overview
Your body requires vitamin B12 to maintain metabolism, produce DNA and red blood cells, and keep your nervous system healthy, among other things. Most people managed to get enough of this water-soluble nutrient from their regular diet. However, some people may require more than what they can get from their daily diet. That is why you need to check for a vitamin B12 test, to know whether you are deficient in the same or not. Your doctor may suggest you go for the test to diagnose various health issues as well. Here we have discussed the vitamin B12 test price, the procedure, and many more.
Understanding the source of Vitamin B12:
Vitamin B12 is naturally found in a wide variety of animal foods, and some fortified foods contain it as well. Unless fortified, plant foods contain no vitamin B12. You can get enough vitamin B12 by eating a variety of foods, including the ones listed below:
•	Vitamin B12 can be found in fish, meat, poultry, eggs, beef liver, milk, and other dairy products as well.
•	Vitamin B12 is added to some breakfast cereals, nutritional yeasts, and other foods.
Other than the diet, you can also get the required quantity of supplements. It is usually in the form of cyanocobalamin in supplements and is available in different forms.
